This is a simple minimal weather web app created by me for my CS50 project
#### Video Demo:

Most of us prefer to go through public transport and if it rains and you don't have an umbrella you will fall into a big trouble.
You will get a pop up asking for location access for the first time, just allow the location inorder to determine the weather for your location and you will get the weather info for the area you live.
You can even switch between celsius and fahrenheit according to your preference. The weather info is provided from Dark Sky.
Json is used inorder to connect with the server and the web. Css is used for the styles and effects and the script is from java. Implementation is done by html.
Below you will see the future forecast for three more days.
